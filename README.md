Your job is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.Main task is to cluster the countries by the factors mentioned above and then present your solution and recommendations to the CEO using a PPT.
